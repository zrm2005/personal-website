    <h3>Information Technology Student at Mizzou</h3>

    <p>
      I am an Information Technology major at the University of Missouri. 
      I created this website to showcase my growth, interests, and career goals in technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      My primary interests include cybersecurity, networking, and understanding 
      how systems are built and protected. I am constantly working to improve my 
      technical skills through coursework and hands-on practice.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Consistency beats intensity.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This site will continue to grow as I develop new skills and gain experience 
      in the IT field.
