    <h3>Who I Am and My Goals</h3>

    <p>
      I am an Information Technology major at the University of Missouri. 
      I chose this field because I am interested in how systems operate, how 
      networks connect, and how security protects digital information.
    </p>

    <p>
      My primary interest is cybersecurity, and I hope to work in a government 
      role after college. I am focused on building strong technical skills 
      through coursework, projects, and hands-on learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of academics, I enjoy going to the gym, cars, and spending time 
      with friends. I believe consistency and discipline are important qualities 
      both in personal development and in building a career in technology.
